# phposxinstall
My Installation of PHP and Tools for OSX

## Install textmate 2

* Download Textmate 2 at : http://api.textmate.org/downloads/beta 
* Install it in your app directory
* Run Textmate to install the CLI version
	* It will be in the menu : TextMate | Preferences | Terminal 
	* Click install

## Determine a "Projects" directory

You'll need to determine a directory for all projects.
I recommend ~/projects, so it's the one I'll use on all examples. Please fell free to change it.
     
* Execute
```console
cd
mkdir -pv projects
```

## Install Alias and Configuration for the Command Line.

* Check with `ls ~/.profile`, if you have a .profile file
* If you have one, rename it (i.e. profile.txt ), then youâ€™ll be able to your .bashrc file. We use .bashrc for your own configuration, and .profile for this install and any updates of installation and alias.
* Copy .profile in your home directory
```console
cp profile.txt ~/.profile
```
	
* Execute
```console
source ~/.profile
```

## Install Xcode

* Run the App Store
* Find and Choose Download on Xcode
* Once the installation finishes, start Xcode to complete the installation.

## Install Homebrew

* Execute
      
```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew doctor
brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew tap homebrew/php
brew update
brew upgrade
```
	
Please correct the problems brew doctor will give you. It might be different for every body.

## Install tools, git & newer version of autoconf

* Execute
```console
brew install autoconf git ack wget curl redis memcached libmemcached colordiff imagemagick icoutils gettext icu4c libxml2 unixodbc readline bash-git-prompt

## Install Redis

As redis is more an more usefull and will be used in some of our tools, it's already installed. But : 

* To have launchd start redis now and restart at login:
```sh
brew services start redis
```

* Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
```sh
redisstart
```

## Install Memcached

As memcached is  usefull and will be used in some of our tools, it's already installed. But :
