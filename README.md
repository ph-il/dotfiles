My Installation of PHP and Tools for OSX

## Determine a "Projects" directory

You'll need to determine a directory for all projects.
I recommend ~/projects, so it's the one I'll use on all examples. Please fell free to change it.
     
* Execute
```sh
cd
mkdir -pv projects
```

## Install Alias and Configuration for the Command Line.

* Check with `ls ~/.profile`, if you have a .profile file
* If you have one, rename it (i.e. profile.txt ), then you’ll be able to your .bashrc file. We use .bashrc for your own configuration, and .profile for this install and any updates of installation and alias.
* Copy .profile in your home directory
```sh
cp profile.txt ~/.profile
```
	
* Execute
```sh
source ~/.profile
```

## Install Xcode

* Run the App Store
* Find and Choose Download on Xcode
* Once the installation finishes, start Xcode to complete the installation.
