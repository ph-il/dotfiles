# phposxinstall
My Installation of PHP and Tools for OSX

## Install textmate 2

* Download Textmate 2 at : http://api.textmate.org/downloads/beta 
* Install it in your app directory
* Run Textmate to install the CLI version
	* It will be in the menu : TextMate | Preferences | Terminal 
	* Click install

## Determine a "Projects" directory

You'll need to determine a directory for all projects.
I recommend ~/projects, so it's the one I'll use on all examples. Please fell free to change it.
     
* Execute
	cd
	mkdir -pv projects
